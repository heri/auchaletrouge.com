Si vous voulez partir après, nous ferons de notre mieux mais nous ne pouvons pas faire de promesses pour vous garantir un accès après.

## Departure checklist

We offer full-service rentals and take responsibility to fully clean between guests. You do not need to strip your beds, launder linens, or wash the last set of dishes.

How clean are you expected to leave the home? A good rule of thumb is that if your mother were to see the home upon your departure, she should not be embarrassed!

While you are not expected to do a thorough cleaning, please be reasonable. Rinse your dishes and cookware and place in the dishwasher. Do not leave filthy dishes or garbage strewn about. Clean up after major messes, spills and accidents or bring them to our attention.

Checklist:

* Sign the guest book!
* Close and lock all windows
* Ensure that all faucets are off
* In winter, turn thermostat down to about 15 degrees C
* Turn off all lights
* Ensure that the TV, heatpump, fire stove, BBQ are turned off
* Make sure the dishwasher cycle is started. Otherwise the cleaning staff has to hand wash the dishes
* Triple check the house to ensure you have not left anything behind, including phone chargers, laptop cords, jewelry, passports, wallets, clothing, toys and any leftover food or grocery items
* Pull front door shut behind you and make sure it locks by touching the word Yale
