Si vous voulez partir après, nous ferons de notre mieux mais nous ne pouvons pas faire de promesses pour vous garantir un accès après.

## Departure checklist

We offer full-service rentals and take responsibility to fully clean between guests. You do not need to strip your beds, launder linens, or wash the last set of dishes.

How clean are you expected to leave the home? A good rule of thumb is that if your mother were to see the home upon your departure, she should not be embarrassed!

While you are not expected to do a thorough cleaning, please be reasonable. Rinse your dishes and cookware and place in the dishwasher. Do not leave filthy dishes or garbage strewn about. Clean up after major messes, spills and accidents or bring them to our attention.


Checklist:

* Sign the guest book!
* Close and lock all windows
* Ensure that all faucets are off
* In winter, turn thermostat down to about 65 degrees
* Turn off all lights
* Ensure that all appliances are turned off
* Triple check the house to ensure you have not left anything behind, including phone chargers, laptop cords, jewelry, passports, wallets, clothing, and toys
* Pull front door shut behind you and make sure it locks by touching the word Schlage

If you have leftover food or grocery items, you may leave them behind for the housekeeping crew to keep, discard, or in the case of unopened non-perishables, leave for subsequent guests.

## Lost and Found
Please triple check the home before departing to ensure you have not left anything behind. Common items left behind include phone chargers, computer cords, passports/licenses, clothes, electronics, eyeglasses, toiletries/makeup, documents, and toys.

If you have left something behind, we use an online tool to reunite you with your belongings. It also provides a way for us to track the search for the item and communicate among our team.
