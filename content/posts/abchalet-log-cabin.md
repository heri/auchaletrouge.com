Leave it all behind and unwind at this waterfront luxury log cabin.

Built on the banks of Rivière Rouge, where mountains and majestic pine forests meet, the log cabin welcomes you year round in the tranquility and beauty of the great Canadian Outdoors. Get on a kayak for a fishing adventure. Enjoy the pristine sand beaches.

The private 1 acre site is perfect for families, couples seeking a luxury escape and groups wanting to get up close and personal with nature; with something for everyone. Au Bonheur offers a large deck for star gazing, a beautiful red chestnut spa for unwinding, and campfires and hammocks to share memories with close friends and family.

_The space_

At night, the view of the night sky and stars is amazing. The cathedral ceiling, large windows and French doors connect you to the natural surroundings.

Cosy inside with a good book or a board game on cooler nights. Wood is omnipresent, from exposed timber beams to the traditional wood stove, lending a warm feel to the entire property. Enjoy peaceful and serene nights with the fluffy pillows and soft beds. Later on, the well-equipped kitchen with breakfast bar makes for a cosy place to cook and eat.

Your hosts created Au Bonheur with love for your absolute enjoyment. Built from native timbers, echoing early Quebec history, the log cabin strive to reconnect guests with nature with every detail thought through. Au bonheur means “at the heart of happiness” which is symbolic of the story that led to its creation and for the happy memories we hope it will bring for those who enjoy a stay at our site.
